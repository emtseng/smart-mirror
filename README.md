# smart-mirror

This repo contains web app and Arduino code for our final project for Wendy Ju's Interactive Device Design.

Check out the wiki to learn more about the final product.

## Installation

First, install the package. There are a lot of dependencies. This will take a little bit.

```
npm i
```

Then, procure a ``.env`` file from Emily to get the API keys. Once that's in the right place, you should be able to run the app.

```
npm start
```

Made with <3 at Cornell Tech.
