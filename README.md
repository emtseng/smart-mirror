# smart-mirror

Final project for Wendy Ju's Interactive Device Design. This is a web app built in Node/Express/React that serves information on New York City subway delays.

## Installation & running the app

First, install the package. There are a lot of dependencies. This will take a little bit.

```
npm i
```

Then, procure a ``.env`` file from Emily to get the API keys. Once that's in the right place, you should be able to run the app.

```
npm start
```
